## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r library}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(GGally)
library(ggcorrplot)
library(gridExtra)
library(mice)
library(VIM)
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(rattle)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r file, echo=FALSE}

library(readr)
ames_student <- read_csv("ames_student.csv")

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
str(ames_student)
summary(ames_student)
```

```{r}
ames_student = ames_student %>% mutate(Above_Median = as_factor(Above_Median)) %>%
  mutate(Above_Median = fct_recode(Above_Median, "NO" = "0", "YES" = "1"))
```
