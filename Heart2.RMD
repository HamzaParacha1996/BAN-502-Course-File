## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(caret)
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
library(rattle)
library(RColorBrewer)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

heart_disease = heart_disease %>% 
  mutate(Sex = as_factor(Sex)) %>%
  mutate(ChestPainType = as_factor(ChestPainType)) %>%
  mutate(RestingECG = as_factor(RestingECG)) %>%
  mutate(ExerciseAngina = as_factor(ExerciseAngina)) %>%
  mutate(ST_Slope = as_factor(ST_Slope)) %>%
  mutate(HeartDisease = as_factor(HeartDisease)) %>%
  mutate(HeartDisease = fct_recode(HeartDisease, "NO" = "0", "Yes" = "1"))

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.



```{r}
set.seed(12345)
heart_split = initial_split(heart_disease, prop = 0.7, strata = HeartDisease)
train = training(heart_split)
test = testing(heart_split)
```

```{r}

heart_recipe = recipe(HeartDisease ~ Age + Sex + ChestPainType + RestingBP + Cholesterol + FastingBS + RestingECG + MaxHR + ExerciseAngina + Oldpeak + ST_Slope, data = train) %>%
  step_dummy(all_nominal(), -all_outcomes())

heart_recipe = recipe(HeartDisease  ~., train) %>%
  step_dummy(all_nominal(), -all_outcomes())

tree_model = decision_tree() %>%
  set_engine("rpart", model = TRUE) %>%
  set_mode("classification")

heart_wflow =
  workflow() %>%
  add_model(tree_model) %>%
  add_recipe(heart_recipe)

tree_fit = fit(heart_wflow, train)


```

```{r}

tree = tree_fit %>%
  pull_workflow_fit() %>%
  pluck("fit")

fancyRpartPlot(tree)
```

```{r}
tree_fit$fit$fit$fit$cptable
```

```{r}


set.seed(123)
folds = vfold_cv(train, v = 5)
```

```{r}

heart_recipe = recipe(HeartDisease ~ Age + Sex + ChestPainType + RestingBP + Cholesterol + FastingBS + RestingECG + MaxHR + ExerciseAngina + Oldpeak + ST_Slope, data = train) %>%
  step_dummy(all_nominal(), -all_outcomes())

tree_model = decision_tree(cost_complexity = tune()) %>%
  set_engine("rpart", model = TRUE) %>%
  set_mode("classification")

tree_grid = grid_regular(cost_complexity(),
                         levels = 25)
heart_wflow =
  workflow() %>%
  add_model(tree_model) %>%
  add_recipe(heart_recipe)

heart_res = 
  heart_wflow %>%
  tune_grid(
    resamples = folds,
    grid = tree_grid
  )

heart_res
```

```{r}
best_tree = heart_res %>%
  select_best("accuracy")

best_tree
```
```{r}
final_wf = 
  heart_wflow %>%
  finalize_workflow(best_tree)
```

```{r}
final_fit =fit(final_wf, train)

heart = final_fit %>%
  pull_workflow_fit() %>%
  pluck("fit")

fancyRpartPlot(heart, tweak = 1.5)
```

```{r}
heartpred = predict(final_fit, train, type = "class")
head(heartpred)
```

```{r}
confusionMatrix(heartpred$.pred_class,train$HeartDisease,positive ="Yes")
```

```{r}
heartpred = predict(final_fit, test, type = "class")
head(heartpred)
```

```{r}
confusionMatrix(heartpred$.pred_class,test$HeartDisease,positive ="Yes")
```
