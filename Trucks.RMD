This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(cluster)
library(dendextend)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}

library(readr)
trucks_1 <- read_csv("trucks-1.csv")
View(trucks_1)

```

```{r}

ggplot(aes(x=Distance, y= Speeding), data=trucks_1) +
  geom_point()



```

```{r}

trucks_cleaned <- select(trucks_1, c('Distance','Speeding')) %>%
  scale()

```
